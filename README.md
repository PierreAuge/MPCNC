# MPCNC
Machinekit configuration customized for the Mostly Printed CNC MPCNC project
This project is derived from sample code https://github.com/machinekit/machinekit/tree/master/configs/ARM/BeagleBone/CRAMPS

This project is more focused on using MPCNC as a gantry mill than a 3d printer. The 
temperature plugin has been stripped out of this project. The main focus is a configuration for dual gantry drives.

If there's interest at the space to build a MPCNC 3dprinter, we could add this in as git branch
